2. Writing Stored Procedures.

3. Writing User Defined Functions(UDFs).

4. Generic Stored Procedures that can be used in Snowflake Projects.



This course has helped me..

1. To understand complex stored procedures written by others.

2. If I want to write simple to complex stored procedures and User Defined Functions.

3. If I want to go through some procedures that can be implemented in your projects with small changes.
